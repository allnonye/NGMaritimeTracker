Competed in a Northrop Grumman Competition sponsored and hosted at UMD and placed 1/15 teams of 1-4. Developed a Python/MATLAB application to detect and classify a variety of maritime vessels in real-time. More specifically, the application kept an accurate frame-by-frame catalogue of such vessels, and categorized them into civilians, warships, aircraft carriers, and submarines. Csv file also outputted for accuracy checking. The competition spanned a 6 week period, and mentor meetings were biweekly. Research on object detection and utilization of open source machine learning software such as YOLOv5 and Google Colab were used to supplement project success. Training data was scraped from Google and Bing Images.
